<b>Website Visitors</b>
Like most website operators, weblog.sh collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. weblog.sh’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how weblog.sh’s visitors use its website. From time to time, weblog.sh may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

weblog.sh also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on weblog.sh blogs. weblog.sh only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

<b>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</b>
Users of weblog.sh’s services choose to interact with weblog.sh in ways that require weblog.sh to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that weblog.sh gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at weblog.sh to provide a username.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using weblog.sh’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. weblog.sh will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, weblog.sh discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when weblog.sh believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of weblog.sh, third parties or the public at large.
