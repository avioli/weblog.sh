      <h2>ABOUT weblog.sh</h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      weblog.sh is a blogging platform, it's designed to cease being one if a feature is removed, based on the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducibility">irreducibility</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently the only way to create and manage a blog on it is through the supplied client aptly named weblog.sh, a bash script.
    </p>

    <p>
      We acknowledge that this makes the service accessible only to a niche crowd, and so we are considering adding an alternative way to blog.
    </p>

    <h2>True Minimalism</h2>

    <blockquote cite="http://practicaltypography.com/billionaires-typewriter.html">
      <p>
        the minimalist program — as it initially emerged in fine art of the 20th century — has been about diverting the viewer’s attention from overt signs of authorship to the deeper purity of the ingredients.

    <p>
      A lot of blogging platforms overclaim their minimalism but do not adhere to its definitions, simply because it is not practical for their business to truly rid themselves of the cruft.
    </p>

    <h2>Anonymity</h2>

    <p>
      A side-effect of its irreducibility is that it holds as little information needed as possible to continue fulfilling its definition. Which in turn makes users anonymous to the service<sup>1</sup>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not completely unintentional though, with the advent of hyper-sensitivity in the internet some <a href="https://medium.com/@johncwelch/samantha-and-the-great-big-lie-d146a92473a1">critical writers</a> need a platform where they can write as their pseudonyms without the risk of exposure even in the case of a data breach.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also do not have any third party tracking installed, and solely rely on the access logs to anticipate traffic and scale accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      <small>1: with the exception of access logs containing IPs that are cleared out regularly, we suggest using a proxy</small>
    </p>

    <h2>Downsides</h2>

    <p>
      Because we decided not to hold personally identifying information, we cannot employ paid subscriptions to help support the longevity of the service.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead we are currently setting up opt-in services that would allow users to anonymously pledge an amount of money weekly/monthly.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the time of writing we are spending around $15 a month to keep the service up. <em>- 27/10/15</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Open Source</h2>

    <p>
      The source to the platform and CLI client is available on <a href="https://github.com/hmngwy/weblog.sh">Github</a>, with the exception of server configuration files that hold SSL information. Anyone is invited to contribute and report issues there.
